title: Return to the web
---

When I worked for universities, I had a very visible public presence. Anyone
I talked to could easily google for me and find my recent projects, papers,
etc.  Without even trying, I was the first hit on Google. But 7 years ago,
I moved to industry and suddenly I was invisible. I had no web page, there was
no single collection of all my publications, nothing about recent projects,
nothing about the people I work with. And I often can't say much about my
current project until all the patents are filed or because we're working with
another company and there are confidentiality requirements.

So this is me returning to the web.  I probably won't say much about my current
project but at least you can see a little of what I've worked on, my
publications and my patents.
