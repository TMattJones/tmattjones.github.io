    Carlsson and Hallgren describe the implementation of a set of
    "functional widgets" (Fudgets): components for programming graphical
    user interfaces under the X window system using the non-strict
    functional programming language Haskell.
    We describe an alternative implementation based on existing
    widget sets (currently Openlook and Motif).
    Our purpose is twofold: to show that the Fudgets approach can be
    applied to existing widget sets; and to discuss problems experienced
    with Fudgets during an industrial case study.
