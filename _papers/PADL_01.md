abstract: |
    Functional programming languages are not generally associated
    with computationally intensive tasks such as computer vision. We show
    that a declarative programming language like Haskell is effective for
    describing complex visual tracking systems. We have taken an existing
    C++ library for computer vision, called XVision, and used it to build
    FVision (pronounced ``fission''), a library of Haskell types and
    functions that provides a high-level interface to the lower-level
    XVision code. Using functional abstractions, users of FVision can
    build and test new visual tracking systems rapidly and reliably. The
    use of Haskell does not degrade system performance: computations are
    dominated by low-level calculations expressed in C++ while the
    Haskell ``glue code'' has a negligible impact on performance.
    <p>
    FVision is built using functional reactive programming (FRP) to
    express interaction in a purely functional manner. The resulting
    system demonstrates the viability of mixed-language programming:
    visual tracking programs continue to spend most of their time
    executing low-level image-processing code, while Haskell's advanced
    features allow us to develop and test systems quickly and with
    confidence. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of Haskell and FRP
    to express many basic abstractions of visual tracking.
