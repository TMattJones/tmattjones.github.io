I am an experienced researcher in computer hardware, programming languages,
operating systems and embedded systems currently working in the exciting area
of energy-efficient mobile computing.
I have 14 granted patents (computer hardware and compilation), about a dozen
pending applications (hardware and software) and about a dozen published
papers.
My most distracting hobby at the moment is building my own keyboards.

Specialties: Research in microprocessor architecture, microarchitecture,
parallel programming, parallelizing compilers, functional programming,
operating systems.
