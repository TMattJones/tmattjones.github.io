I am a senior principal research engineer at ARM Ltd.
currently working on
[formal specification of the ARM processor architecture](/activities#mechanised-processor-specification).
My research revolves around the interplay between software, compilers, architecture and
microarchitecture in microprocessors resulting in system prototypes,
[patents and papers](/papers/).

I have worked on
[formal verification of ARM processors](/activities#processor-formal-verification),
[formalizing ARM's architecture specification](/activities#mechanised-processor-specification),
[vectorizing compilers](/activities#vectorizing-compiler-for-neon),
[created a language and compiler for programming heterogeneous parallel system](/activities#software-defined-radio)
software-defined radio,
testcase generation,
architectural coverage analysis,
CPU simulators and the ARMv8 architecture.
My most distracting hobby at the moment is
[building my own keyboards](/building-keyboards/).

Specialties: Research in formal verification,
microprocessor architecture, microarchitecture,
parallel programming, parallelizing compilers, functional programming,
operating systems.
