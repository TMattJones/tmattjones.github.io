My research revolves around the interplay between software, compilers, architecture and
microarchitecture in microprocessors resulting in system prototypes, patents
and papers.
I have worked on formal verification of ARM processors, formalising ARM's
architecture specification, vectorizing compilers, created a language and
compiler for programming heterogeneous parallel system, software-defined radio,
testcase generation, architectural coverage analysis, CPU simulators and the
ARMv8 architecture.
My most distracting hobby at the moment is building my own keyboards.

Specialties: Research in formal verification,
microprocessor architecture, microarchitecture,
parallel programming, parallelizing compilers, functional programming,
operating systems.
